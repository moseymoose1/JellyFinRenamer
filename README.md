# JellyFinRenamer
Python script that renames season folders to match Jellyfin's naming convention. Supports [tags]. 

//INSTRUCTIONS//
1. Execute the run.bat file.
2. Copy the folder path from windows by right clicking on the address bar in explorer, ENTER.
3. List any tags you wish to add to the file names superated by ; e.i. 2160p;HDR (this will apply to all files in the folder)
4. If you do not wish to add any tags, just hit ENTER with no values provided.

*The run.bat should always be kept in the same folder as the JellyFinRename.py as the batch file will always look for the script in the current directory.
