**JellyfinRenamer**

Python script that parses existing file names for season and episode terms and renames all files in a specified folder to match Jellyfin's naming convention. Supports [tags]. Files must have terms SXXEXX somewhere in the filename. Use it to tidy up downloaded seasons to work with Jellyfin.

**Instructions**
1. Execute the run.bat file.
2. Copy the folder path from windows by right clicking on the address bar in explorer, ENTER.
3. List any tags you wish to add to the file names superated by ; e.i. 2160p;HDR (this will apply to all files in the folder)
4. If you do not wish to add any tags, just hit ENTER with no values provided.

*The run.bat should always be kept in the same folder as the JellyFinRename.py as the batch file will always look for the script in the current directory.
